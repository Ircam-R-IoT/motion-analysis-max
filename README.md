# motion analysis max objects

## max objects performing motion analysis on the BITalino R-IoT's input

#### installation

Drop all subfolders somewhere into `Documents/Max 7/Library`.  
The `max-motion-features` folder contains a collection of max abstractions
computing some feature descriptors specific to gesture signals,
from accelerometer and gyroscope input.  

#### getting started

To see the whole set of abstractions in action, open the
`bitalino-riot-analysis-example.maxpat` patch, and connect your R-IoT
to get some input.

To see how the bitalino object parses the input, have a look at the
`bitalino-riot-basic.maxpat` patch.
